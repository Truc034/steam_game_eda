## ‚úÖ Recommendations Based on Analysis Results

### For Developers
**Focus on Quality Over Quantity** üèÜ
- Prioritize 10-20 high-quality titles rather than mass production
- Target review ratios of 0.4-0.6 or higher for sustained success
- Consider niche genres (Strategy, RPG, Simulation) for less competition

**Optimize Pricing Strategy** üí∞
- Use $10-30 as the sweet spot for balancing accessibility and value perception
- Avoid underpricing; higher prices work when value is clearly justified

### For Publishers
**Strategic Market Approach** üéØ
- Embrace quality over quantity in portfolio development
- Target mature audiences (age 25-45) for stable, valuable demographics
- Use early review patterns to monitor and adjust title performance

**DLC Strategy** üöÄ
- Launch DLC after core game proves successful
- Base DLC development on player feedback
- Ensure DLC quality matches core experience

### For Investors
**Market Intelligence** üìä
- Track normalized value scores to identify long-term performers  
- Invest in developers with consistent review quality across titles
- Monitor genre trends and emerging niches

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è
