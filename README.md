## üéØ 1. Objectives

This project analyzes the Steam game market to understand characteristics that contribute to game success. Key objectives include:

- Understanding the Steam market landscape (size, genre diversity, pricing strategies)
- Identifying trends in game releases, user engagement, and success patterns over time
- Uncovering relationships between game attributes (price, genre, reviews, DLC) and success metrics
- Formulating strategic recommendations for optimal game development and marketing on Steam

## üìÇ 2. Dataset sources

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Steam Games Dataset by Fronkongames](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset/data)

## üí° Key Insights Discovered

### Market Structure
- **Massive Scale:** Over 85,000 games across 33 genres
- **Rapid Growth:** 650% increase in yearly releases from 2014-2024
- **Pricing:** Median price $4.99, with most games affordably priced
- **Market Concentration:** Few hits dominate; most games have moderate engagement

### Genre Performance
- **Mainstream Genres** (Indie, Action, Adventure): High volume but intense competition
- **Strategic Genres** (Strategy, RPG, Simulation): Strong engagement with loyal audiences
- **Professional Tools:** Low engagement but higher price tolerance

### Success Patterns
- **Quality Drives Success:** Higher review ratios correlate with popularity
- **Sweet Spot Pricing:** $10-30 range balances accessibility and perceived value
- **Mature Market:** Adult-oriented games show higher price tolerance and engagement
- **DLC Effectiveness:** Most successful as post-launch extensions, not initial drivers

### Developer Insights
- **Indie Advantage:** Independent developers achieve better review ratios (0.64 vs 0.57)
- **Market Opportunity:** Top 10 publishers hold only 2.7% market share

## üß† Hypotheses Based on Insights

1. **Quality-First Hypothesis:** Games with higher review ratios will achieve greater popularity regardless of genre or price
2. **Strategic Pricing Hypothesis:** Games priced in the $10-30 range will show optimal value scores and sales performance
3. **Niche Focus Hypothesis:** High-quality niche content can yield higher ROI despite lower overall engagement
4. **Post-Launch DLC Hypothesis:** DLC developed after establishing a strong player base significantly extends profitability
5. **Mature Audience Hypothesis:** Games targeting adult audiences can command higher prices and achieve stable returns

## ‚úÖ Recommendations Based on Analysis Results

### For Developers
**Focus on Quality Over Quantity** üèÜ
- Prioritize 10-20 high-quality titles rather than mass production
- Target review ratios of 0.4-0.6 or higher for sustained success
- Consider niche genres (Strategy, RPG, Simulation) for less competition

**Optimize Pricing Strategy** üí∞
- Use $10-30 as the sweet spot for balancing accessibility and value perception
- Avoid underpricing; higher prices work when value is clearly justified
- Consider tiered pricing and demo offerings

### For Publishers
**Strategic Market Approach** üéØ
- Embrace quality over quantity in portfolio development
- Target mature audiences (age 25-45) for stable, valuable demographics
- Use early review patterns to monitor and adjust title performance

**DLC Strategy** üöÄ
- Launch DLC after core game proves successful
- Base DLC development on player feedback
- Ensure DLC quality matches core experience

### For Investors
**Market Intelligence** üìä
- Track normalized value scores to identify long-term performers  
- Invest in developers with consistent review quality across titles
- Monitor genre trends and emerging niches

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Optimizing for review scores instead of genuine player satisfaction
- Launching DLC too early in game lifecycle
- Underpricing due to fear of low sales
- Ignoring the valuable adult market segment
