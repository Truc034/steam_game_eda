## üéØ Goals of the Project

This project analyzes the Steam game market to identify key factors contributing to game success and provide actionable insights for developers and publishers. The primary objectives include:

- Understanding the Steam market landscape (size, genre diversity, pricing strategies)
- Identifying trends in game releases, user engagement, and success patterns over time
- Uncovering relationships between game attributes (price, genre, reviews, DLC) and success metrics
- Formulating strategic recommendations for optimal game development and marketing on Steam

## üìä Data Sources Used

**Primary Dataset:** Steam Games Dataset from Kaggle
- **Source:** `fronkongames/steam-games-dataset` on Kaggle Hub
- **Original Size:** 111,452 games √ó 39 columns
- **Analysis Period:** 2004 to May 2025
- **Final Dataset:** 85,268 games √ó 54 features (after cleaning and feature engineering)

## üîç Data Overview

The dataset contains comprehensive information about games available on the Steam platform.

### Key Original Columns:
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| AppID | Unique Steam game identifier |
| Name | Game title |
| Release date | Game launch date |
| Estimated owners | Range of estimated game owners |
| Price | Game price in USD |
| Positive/Negative | Number of positive/negative reviews |
| Recommendations | User recommendations count |
| Genres | Game genres (e.g., Action, RPG, Indie) |
| Developers/Publishers | Game creators and distributors |
| DLC count | Number of downloadable content packages |

### Data Preprocessing:
- Removed non-game entries (beta, demo, SDK, tools)
- Filtered games from 2004-2024 (complete years only)
- Converted estimated owner ranges to numeric midpoints
- Handled missing values with appropriate defaults
- Applied outlier capping at 99th percentile

### Feature Engineering:
- **Popularity Score:** Time-normalized composite metric (owners: 50%, reviews: 30%, recommendations: 20%)
- **Value Score:** (Popularity √ó Review Ratio) √∑ (Price + 1)
- **Review Ratio:** Positive reviews / Total reviews
- **Price Categories:** Free, Under $10, $10-30, $30-60, Over $60
- **Genre Encoding:** One-hot encoded 33 genres for analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Applied

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` - Data manipulation and analysis
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` - Data visualization  
  - `sklearn` - Machine learning preprocessing
  - `kagglehub` - Dataset acquisition
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Processing:** Feature engineering, outlier treatment, normalization

## üí° Key Insights Discovered

### Market Structure
- **Massive Scale:** Over 85,000 games across 33 genres
- **Rapid Growth:** 650% increase in yearly releases from 2014-2024
- **Pricing:** Median price $4.99, with most games affordably priced
- **Market Concentration:** Few hits dominate; most games have moderate engagement

### Genre Performance
- **Mainstream Genres** (Indie, Action, Adventure): High volume but intense competition
- **Strategic Genres** (Strategy, RPG, Simulation): Strong engagement with loyal audiences
- **Professional Tools:** Low engagement but higher price tolerance

### Success Patterns
- **Quality Drives Success:** Higher review ratios correlate with popularity
- **Sweet Spot Pricing:** $10-30 range balances accessibility and perceived value
- **Mature Market:** Adult-oriented games show higher price tolerance and engagement
- **DLC Effectiveness:** Most successful as post-launch extensions, not initial drivers

### Developer Insights
- **Indie Advantage:** Independent developers achieve better review ratios (0.64 vs 0.57)
- **Market Opportunity:** Top 10 publishers hold only 2.7% market share

## üß† Hypotheses Based on Insights

1. **Quality-First Hypothesis:** Games with higher review ratios will achieve greater popularity regardless of genre or price
2. **Strategic Pricing Hypothesis:** Games priced in the $10-30 range will show optimal value scores and sales performance
3. **Niche Focus Hypothesis:** High-quality niche content can yield higher ROI despite lower overall engagement
4. **Post-Launch DLC Hypothesis:** DLC developed after establishing a strong player base significantly extends profitability
5. **Mature Audience Hypothesis:** Games targeting adult audiences can command higher prices and achieve stable returns

## ‚úÖ Recommendations Based on Analysis Results

### For Developers
**Focus on Quality Over Quantity** üèÜ
- Prioritize 10-20 high-quality titles rather than mass production
- Target review ratios of 0.4-0.6 or higher for sustained success
- Consider niche genres (Strategy, RPG, Simulation) for less competition

**Optimize Pricing Strategy** üí∞
- Use $10-30 as the sweet spot for balancing accessibility and value perception
- Avoid underpricing; higher prices work when value is clearly justified
- Consider tiered pricing and demo offerings

### For Publishers
**Strategic Market Approach** üéØ
- Embrace quality over quantity in portfolio development
- Target mature audiences (age 25-45) for stable, valuable demographics
- Use early review patterns to monitor and adjust title performance

**DLC Strategy** üöÄ
- Launch DLC after core game proves successful
- Base DLC development on player feedback
- Ensure DLC quality matches core experience

### For Investors
**Market Intelligence** üìä
- Track normalized value scores to identify long-term performers  
- Invest in developers with consistent review quality across titles
- Monitor genre trends and emerging niches

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Optimizing for review scores instead of genuine player satisfaction
- Launching DLC too early in game lifecycle
- Underpricing due to fear of low sales
- Ignoring the valuable adult market segment
